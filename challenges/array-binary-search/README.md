# Array Search
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge
Tricky to do without .find()

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n), will always take as long as the length of the array.

I will not be implementing a binary-search algoritihm, instead I will just check the values one by one to find the sought value
