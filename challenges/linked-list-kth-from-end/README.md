# Singly Linked List Implementation
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Challenge
With a doubly linked list, this is a pretty straight forward challenge. With a singly linked list, this would be much more challenging without implementing a length counter.

## Approach & Efficiency
