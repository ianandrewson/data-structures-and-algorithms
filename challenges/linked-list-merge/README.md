# Linked List Merge
Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

Stretch: Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, implement another function that merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

## Challenge
Logic that handles linked lists of two different lengths will be a bit challenging. Managing both next and previous properties will also be a significant challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)
