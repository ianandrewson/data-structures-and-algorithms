# Challenge Summary
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

    .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
    .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
    .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

    Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
    Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
    Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
    Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
    Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
    Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list



## Challenge Description
We are continuing to build upon our implementation of linked lists by extending the class' methods.
