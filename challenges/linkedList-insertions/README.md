# Challenge Summary
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

    .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
    .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
    .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
